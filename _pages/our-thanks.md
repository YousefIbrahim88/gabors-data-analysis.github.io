We could not have done is alone. Far from it. So, we are grateful, really. 

## Learning from our students
Let us first thank our students at the Central European University, at the University of Michigan, and
at the University of Reading. The idea of writing a textbook was born out of teaching and mentoring
them. We have learned a lot from teaching them, and many of them helped us writing code, collecting
data, reading papers, and hunting for ideas.

## Advice from Colleagues
Many colleagues helped us with their extremely valuable comments and suggestions. We thank
Eduardo Arino de la Rubia, [Emily Blanchard](http://faculty.tuck.dartmouth.edu/emily-blanchard/), Imre Boda, [Alberto Cairo](http://albertocairo.com/){:target="_blank"}, Gergely Daróczi, János Divényi, [Christian Fons-Rosen](https://sites.google.com/site/cfonsrosen/), Bonnie Kavoussi, Olivér Kiss, [Miklós Koren](https://koren.mk/), [Mike Luca](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=602417), [Róbert Lieli](https://sites.google.com/site/robertplieli/), [László Mátyás](http://www.personal.ceu.hu/staff/matyas/), [Tímea Laura Molnár](https://timea-laura-molnar.com/), [Arieda Muço](https://sites.google.com/view/ariedamuco/home), Jenő Pál, and [Ádám Szeidl](http://www.personal.ceu.hu/staff/Adam_Szeidl/) and anonymous reviewers
of the first draft of the textbook.

## Help on case studies
We have received help with our case studies from [Alberto Cavallo](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=394129), [Daniella Scur](http://www.danielascur.com/), [Nick Bloom](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/), [John van Reenen](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/jvanreenen/), Anikó Kristof, József Keleti, [Emily Oster](https://emilyoster.net/), and MyChelle Andrews. We have learned a lot from them.

## Editing, text development
Several people helped us a great deal with our manuscript. At Cambridge University Press, our
commissioning editor, Phil Good, encouraged us from the day we met. Our editors, Heather Brolly,
Jane Adams, and Nicola Chapman, guided us with kindness and steadfastness from first draft to
proofs. We are not native English speakers, and support from Chris Cartwrigh and Jon Billam was
very useful. 

We are grateful for [Sarolta Rózsás](https://rozsass.github.io/text-dev-editor/), who read and edited endless versions of chapters,
checking consistency and clarity, and pushed us to make the text more coherent and accessible.

The wonderful cover design is based on the work by Ágoston Nagy, his first but surely not his last.


## Coding, translations across scripting languages 
[Zsuzsa Holler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zsuzsa-holler-70bba031/) and [Kinga Ritter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinga-ritter/) have provided enormous development support, spearheading this effort for years. 

Additional code and refactoring in R was created by Máté Tóth, János Bíró, and [Eszter Pázmándi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eszterpazmandi/). János and Máté also created the first version of Python notebooks. Later on Adam Víg joined in. 

Additional coding, data collection, visualization, and editing were done by Viktória Kónya, Zsófia
Kőműves, Dániel Bánki, Abuzar Ali, [Endre Borza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/endremborza/), Imola Csóka, and  [Ahmed Al Shaibani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedalshaibani/).

## The community help
Let us also shout out to the fantastic R user community – both online and offline – from whom
we learned tremendously. Special thanks to the Rstats and Econ Twitter community – we received
wonderful suggestions from tons of people we have never met.

## CEU backing
We thank the Central European University for professional and financial support. Julius Horvath
and Miklós Koren as department heads provided massive support from the day we shared our plans.

## Family
Finally, let us thank those who were with us throughout the long, and often stressful, process of
writing a textbook. Békés thanks Saci; Kézdi thanks Zsuzsanna. We would not have been able to do
it without their love and support.
