The **current, temporary solution** is that you can download the pre-release datasets from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1g5j6v_WtB2lQDrSjpfhuw-P4s3Wm7Ucc){:target="_blank"}   

You will have other options to get the datasets for our case studies. Forthcoming in January 2021.
