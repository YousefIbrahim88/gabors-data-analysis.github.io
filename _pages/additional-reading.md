Life did not stop when we finished the manusdcript. Actually, we keep finding great stuff. So let us make some suggestion for additional readings per chapters. 

### Chapter 09

Regarding **external validity**, one way to check robustness is to take out 1% of the data and repeat the exercise.   
The simple take is to do it many times randonly + many times by edge of distribution of key variables.   
The smart take is suggested by *Tamara Broderick, Ryan Giordano, Rachael Meager in "An Automatic Finite-Sample Robustness Metric: Can Dropping a Little Data Change Conclusions?"* Hard-core statistics. [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14999)


### Chapter 19
On **DAGs and Potential outcomes**, deep discussion for social scientists: *Imbens, Guido W. 2020. "Potential Outcome and Directed Acyclic Graph Approaches to Causality: Relevance for Empirical Practice in Economics." Journal of Economic Literature, 58 (4): 1129-79.* [LINK to paper](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191597). An amazing review that includes Twitter quotes.
