## Get Stata
1. You will need a Stata license to use it. Your institution may have access, check for that.
2. You may ask for a [student license](https://www.stata.com/customer-service/short-term-license/), too.

## Code language versions
1. You will need a Stata version of 13.0 or above. Most code will work with older versions, but we have not checked. We used v.15.1, but all code should work for versions above 13.0. 
2. We saved data in the Stata 13 version.

## How to run case studies in Stata

1. Create a folder structure as described in [setting up folders](/data-and-code/#folder-setup)
2. When you start up stata, set the working directory as your main folder (`cd da-textbook`)
3. When you run a code, just use add the folder name `do case-studies/ch07-hotel-simple-reg/ch07-hotel-simple-reg_intro.do`
4. Note that each code has line to load in user written pacakges, you need to run them once.
