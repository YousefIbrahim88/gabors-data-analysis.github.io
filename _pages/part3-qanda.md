## Chapter 13

Are we using loss function to compare different models? E.g. the smaller the MSE is, the better the model is

Should we care about multicollinearity then, so that we do not overfit the model?

Is model complexity the same as involving "too many" variables into the model?

if we want to avoid adding too many variables to the model, should we also avoid using categorical variables? 

I know we can calculate other loss functions beyond RMSE: MAE, MAPE and directional accuracy. Which one to use, and is it a good idea to combine error statistics with business related metrics?

## Chapter 14

For K-fold cross-validation, after randomly reshuffling my data & splitting it to training-tests, can training data in each "K" overlap, or should they be distinct?

So, LASSO is also a mechanism to rank X(i)'s according to their importance (based on how high Lamda has to be for the X to become zero)?

Also, can you include the same X(i) in different functional forms (if LASSO reduces unimportant variable parameters to zero, it would only keep the relevant form, no)?
