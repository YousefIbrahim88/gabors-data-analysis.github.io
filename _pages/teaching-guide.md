The textbook may be taught at MBA, MA Economics (non-PhD track), MSc in Business Economics/Management, MA in Public Policy, PhD in Management and comparable programs. It also a natural fit in Business Analytics graduate programs.

The textbook is made up of four parts, each with six chapters and an additional short essay. The whole book can be taught over 24--30 weeks in a year-long course. However, several cuts can be made to suit various courses.

Example sequences
* Introductory course in a social program: Chapters 1--10 with some cuts from  heavier material in chapters 5 and 6. Can be the core part of a program with other chapters as an elective.

* Two-year Master's in economics. Use this for the first year, beefing up theory from the under the hood sections. Second year students, especially those set to continue in a PhD program, can have econometrics courses focusing on advanced topics like likelihood estimation, RDD, IV estimation, discrete choice. 
* Business Analytics/Applied Data Science type professional programs: Parts I, II, III as core; IV as elective. Advanced machine learning classes can start after Part III focusing on key methods beyond tree-based models, such as SVM, GBM, neural nets/deep learning. A Bayesian statistics course can also be taught in parallel with Parts II and III.
