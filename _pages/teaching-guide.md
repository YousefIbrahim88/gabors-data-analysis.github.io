## How to use this textbook -- example sequences

The textbook may be taught at MBA, MA Economics (non-PhD track), MSc in Business Economics/Management, MA in Public Policy, PhD in Management and comparable programs. It also a natural fit in Business Analytics graduate programs.

The textbook is made up of four parts, each with six chapters and an additional short essay. The whole book can be taught over 24--30 weeks in a year-long course. However, several cuts can be made to suit various courses.

Example sequences and ideas

### Graduate applied Economics or Quantitative social science program

Programs: Economics, Applied economics, Quantitative Social Science, Economics with Data Science

Duration: 2 semesters

Emphasis: Offering methods a data analysist may need

Sequence: The whole textbook: [Part I](/chapters/part-I/) and [Part II](/chapters/part-II/) and [Part III](/chapters/part-III/)  and [Part IV](/chapters/part-IV/). To fit into a year, advanced sections may be cut from the material or some time series chapters used in a separate course. 



### Undergraduate applied Economics or Quantitative social science program

Programs: Economics, Applied economics, Quantitative Social Science, Economics with Data Science

Duration: 4 semesters

Emphasis: Offering methods a data analysist may need

Sequence: The whole textbook: [Part I](/chapters/part-I/) and [Part II](/chapters/part-II/) and [Part III](/chapters/part-III/)  and [Part IV](/chapters/part-IV/), with some heavier sectiosn omitted. 

The key difference would be spreading out the material over two or three years, covering Part I and Part II in the first two years, with the advanced material left for the 3rd and 4th years, maybe as elective. The key difference to a graduate course should be the speed - more time shall be given students to discover tools. Also, Under the Hood derivations should be included when possible to help transition to graduate / Phd programs.   



### Introductory course in a graduate social science program: 

Programs: Public Policy, Sociology, Economic Policy, International relations

Duration: One 10-12 week semester

Emphasis: Introductory methods from data collection to testing, regression analysis. 

Sequence: [Part I](/chapters/part-I/) and [Part II](/chapters/part-II/) Chapters 1--10 with some cuts from  heavier material in chapters [5](/chapters/part-I/#chapter-05-generalizing-from-data) and [6](/chapters/part-I/#chapter-06-testing-hypotheses). Can be the core part of a program with other chapters as an elective. 


### One or two-year Graduate applied, policy program: 

Programs: Public policy, applied social sciences, Econmic Policy

Duration: 10-15 weeks

Emphasis: Focus on policy applications, regression analysis to causal inference

Sequence:  Refresher course on [Part I](/chapters/part-I/) and do [Part II](/chapters/part-II/) and [Part IV](/chapters/part-IV/) , with maybe some cuts from chapters 1--4. With more advanced students Part II could be covered relatively fast, while students can spend more time on Part IV and read some reference paper. 

Note: The course may be followed for interested students by advanced metrics course with a focus on IV, RDD, etc. 


### Two-year graduate economics program, non-Phd track. 

Programs: Economics, Applied Economics

Duration: 2 semesters (20-24 weeks)

Emphasis: Complete coverage

Sequence: Full coverage including the Under the Hood sections to establish theory background for students taking advanced econometrics courses in the second year. 

Notes: Second year students, especially those set to continue in a PhD program, can have econometrics courses focusing on advanced topics like likelihood estimation, RDD, IV estimation, discrete choice. 


### Business Analytics/Applied Data Science type professional programs: 

Programs: Business Statistics/Management Science/Intro to Data Science in a Business/management program: 

Duration: 15-24 weeks depending on exact coverage

Emphasis: Full introductory and intermediate data analysis, with some advance features. 

Sequence: [Part I](/chapters/part-I/) and [Part II](/chapters/part-II/) and [Part III](/chapters/part-III/)   as core; [Part IV](/chapters/part-IV/) as elective. 

### Core data course in a graduate Business/management program: 

Programs: Business Statistics/Management Science/Intro to Data Science in a Business/management program: 

Duration: One 10-12 week semester

Emphasis: Introduction to key methods and overview of extensions

Sequence: [Part I](/chapters/part-I/) and [Part II](/chapters/part-II/) with some cuts from heavier material in chapters [5](/chapters/part-I/#chapter-05-generalizing-from-data) and [6](/chapters/part-I/#chapter-06-testing-hypotheses). + Chapter [13](/chapters/part-III/#chapter-13-a-framework-for-prediction) to give an idea on prediction and + Chapter [20](/chapters/part-IV/#chapter-20-designing-and-analyzing-experiments) to give an idea on experiments.
