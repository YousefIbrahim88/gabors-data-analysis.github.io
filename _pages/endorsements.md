>**"This exciting new text covers everything today's aspiring data scientist needs to know, managing to be comprehensive as well as accessible.Like a good confidence interval, the Gabors have got you almost completely covered!"**  



[Nicholas Bloom](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu), Stanford Econ & Business School  
>**"This is an excellent book for students learning the art of modern data analytics. This book combines the latest techniques with practical applications, replicating the implementation side of classroom teaching that is typically missing in text books.** For example, they used the World Management Survey data to generate exercises on firm performance for students to gain experience in handling real data, with all its quirks, problems and issues. **For students looking to learn data analysis from one textbook this is a great way to proceed.**"  

>**"This is a fantastic book to have. Strong data skills are critical for modern business and economic research, and this text provides a thorough and practical guide to acquiring them. Highly recommended."**  
[John van Reenen](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/jvanreenen/), MIT Sloan & Economics

>"I know of few books about data analysis and visualization that are as comprehensive, deep, practical, and current as this one; and I know of almost none that are as fun to read. **Gábor Békés and Gábor Kézdi have created a most unusual and most compelling beast: a textbook that teaches you the subject manner well and that, at the same time, you can enjoy reading cover-to-cover.**”  
[Alberto Cairo](http://albertocairo.com), University of Miami, School of Journalism

>"**A multifaceted book that considers many sides of data analysis, all of them important for the contemporary student and practitioner.** It brings together classical statistics, regression, and causal inference, sending the message that awareness of all three aspects is important for success in this field. Many "best practices" are discussed in accessible language and illustrated using interesting datasets."  
[llya Ryzhov](https://scholar.rhsmith.umd.edu/iryzhov/home?destination=home), University of Maryland (Smith Business - Decisions, Operations and IT)

>"This book takes you by the hand in a journey that will bring you to understand the core value of data in the fields of of machine learning and economics. The large amount of accessible examples combined with the intuitive explanation of foundational concepts is an ideal mix for anyone who wants to do data analysis. **It is highly recommended to anyone interested in the new way in which data will be analyzed in the social science in the next years."**   
Christian Fons-Rosen(https://sites.google.com/site/cfonsrosen/) University of California at Merced & Barcelona GSE 


>"Energy and climate change represents one of the most important public policy challenges and high quality data and its empirical analysis is a foundation of solid policy. Data Analysis for Business Economics and Policy will have an impotant contribution to this with its innovative approach. **In addition to the comprehensive treatment of modern econometric techniques, the book also covers the less glamourous but crucial aspects of procuring and cleaning data and drawing useful inferences from less than perfect datasets.** As the center of gravity of the energy system shifts to developing economies where data quality is still an issue this will provide an important and practical combination for both academic and policy professionals."  
Chief Economist. Laszlo Varro, Intl Energy Agency chief econ
