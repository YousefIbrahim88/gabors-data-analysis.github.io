## This textbook
This textbook provides future data analysts with the tools, methods, and skills needed to answer data-focused, real life questions, to carry out data analysis, and to visualize and interpret results to support better decisions in business, economics, and public policy.
Data wrangling and exploration, regression analysis, machine learning, and causal analysis are comprehensively covered, as well as when, why, and how the methods work, and how they relate to each other.

As the most effective way to communicate data analysis, running case studies play a central role in this textbook. Each case starts with an industry relevant question and answers it by using real-world data and applying the tools and methods covered in the textbook. Learning is then consolidated by over 360 practice questions and 110 data exercises. Extensive online resources, including raw and cleaned data and codes for all analysis in Stata, R, and Python are available on this site.

## Why use this book?

**Data analysis is a process**. It starts with formulating a question and collecting appropriate data, or assessing whether the available data can help answer the question. Then comes cleaning and organizing the data, tedious but essential tasks that affect the results of the analysis as much as any other step in the process. Exploratory data analysis gives context to the eventual results and helps deciding the details of the analytical method to be applied. The main analysis consists of choosing and implementing the method to answer the question, with potential robustness checks. Along the way, correct interpretation and effective presentation of the results are crucial. Carefully crafted data visualization help summarize our findings and convey key messages. The final task is to answer the original question, with potential qualifications and directions for future inquiries.

Our textbook **equips future data analysts with the most important tools, methods and skills** they need through the entire process of data analysis to answer data focused, real life questions. We cover all the fundamental methods that help along the process of data analysis. The textbook is divided into four parts covering **data wrangling and exploration, regression analysis, prediction with machine learning, and causal analysis**. We explain when, why, and how the various methods work, and how they are related to each other. [MORE on content](/chapters)

To cover all of the steps that are necessary to carry out an actual data analysis project, we **lean on 47 fully developed case studies**. While each case study focuses on the particular method discussed in the chapter, they illustrate all elements of the process from question through analysis to conclusion.

We share all raw and cleaned data we use in the case studies. We also share the codes that clean the data and produce all results, tables, and graphs in **Stata, R, and Python** so students can tinker with our code and compare the solutions in the different software.

This textbook was written to be a **complete course** in data analysis. This textbook could be useful for university students in graduate programs as **core text** in applied statistics and econometrics, quantitative methods, or data analysis. It may also **complement online courses** that teach specific methods to give more context and explanation. Undergraduate courses can also make use of this textbook, even though the workload on students exceeds the typical undergraduate workload. Finally, the textbook can serve as a **handbook for practitioners** to guide them through all steps of real-life data analysis. [MORE on why use this book?](/whythisbook)
