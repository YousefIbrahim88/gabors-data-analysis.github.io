Here is some tip and advice on how to learn coding

# R
There are two toungues in R, called *data.table* and *tidyverse*. We use *tidyverse*. To learn you may start with the wonderful book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/){:target="_blank"}. 


# Stata


# Python



# Learning a new language

## From Stata to R
In Economics and many other social sciences, we use Stata for research, and learnt R or Python as a second language. Here are some links and tutorials we found useful.

## From R to Python
For this textbook, Stata and R code were developed early on, and we started to work on Python code set only after the proof was ready. Some ideas we (and our RAs) found useful

## From Python to R
If you are coming from, say, a computer science background, chances are that your first language is Python. Suppose you wanna learn R to reach a larger social science community.
