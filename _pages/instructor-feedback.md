## ESSEC Business School Phd  - course on econometrics 

>[Prof Andras Fulop](https://faculty.essec.edu/en/cv/en-fulop-andras/){:target="_blank"}, Professor of Finance, ESSEC Business School


**What kind of program was the book used and what parts of the book were used?**

I used the book in an introductory econometrics course in the doctoral program of a business school. I had students from marketing, management, accounting, operations research and finance. 

This was a class of 10 sessions, 2.5 hours each, we had time to cover the basic cross-sectional case and add in some machine learning and the basics on causality. 

We covered Chapters 4-11,13-14,19-21


**Why did you pick this book, and how does it compare to some existing text?**

I have been looking for a book that takes a more application-oriented approach compared to standard econometrics texts. 

A particular advantage of the book was the large number of worked out case studies coded in several languages (some students used Stata, some R) that really helped to drive home the intuition. 

Two other features that I found very useful: the intro to machine learning methods (by now these should be part of the standard econometric toolbox)  and the discussion of causality. This latter topic is crucial for doctoral students in applied areas such as a business school.
 
 
**What advice would you give to Instructors teaching or developing similar course?**

I think for an Introductory Econometrics class in business schools, the book is a perfect textbook, supplemented with a bit more advanced theoretical material on the basic econometric properties of regression estimators (consistency, asymptotic standard errors under different assumptions).
 
**What did your student appreciate the most?**

The case studies came out from their feedback as the most useful.
