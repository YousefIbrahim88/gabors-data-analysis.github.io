For now, visit the Github page [github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da_case_studies](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da_case_studies){:target="_blank"} where the live version of the code is available. Since the release, we are making small edits to the code, to make them simpler or faster. 


Later on you have two options to get code for our case studies.

1.  Download all code in [R](code-zip-r), [Stata](code-zip-stata), [Python](code-zip-python) --- `release 1.0 (2020-11-21)`
2.  Download code one by one [from the Case studies page](/casestudies)
