The codebase for the whole textbook lives in github:

>  [github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da_case_studies](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da_case_studies){:target="_blank"} 

  This is where the live version of the code is available. Since the first `v.0.6.0` [pre-release](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da_case_studies/releases/tag/v0.6.0)  , we are making small edits to the code, to make them simpler or faster. Plus, adding more and more python scripts. 

You may also download code one by one [from the Case studies page](/casestudies)

Along with the publication in early 2021, there will be official zipped release files. 


% Later on you have two options to get code for our case studies.
% 1.  Download all code in [R](code-zip-r), [Stata](code-zip-stata), [Python](code-zip-python) --- `release 1.0 (2020-11-21)`
