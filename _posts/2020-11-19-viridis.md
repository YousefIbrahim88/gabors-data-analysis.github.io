About two years ago, we had to make final decision about how the graphs in the textbook will loook like. I am an economist, and well, I know about ten colors. I have had no idea what is a *hue* or xxx is . I did not really know what a color scheme was. 

Then, two things happen. First TV shows about interior design with their discussion of color schemes. This is when I first learnt that what I color blueish green is actually *teal*.  Second, we had a serious discussion with Gabor K - he is color blind (as are about 6% of population) on what he may and may not see. So we needed to decide on how we use colors. 
Third I had a chat with the Publisher who told me that there are no more 2 or 3-color books, it is either a single color or full color. So if we wanna have colors, we can have as many colors as we'd like. 

As a result, we realized, we can have *many* colors, but not *any* colors. And we need a scheme. So here were our needs
1. For some graphs, we would need many colors not just a few
2. We want to use colors to represent values on a less-more (few-many) scale
3. Color blind folks should see them all right 
4. Bonus: a black and white copy shall work, ie light and dark instead of some colors. 

I searched around untill I found a wonderful [video on Viridis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU). This is a conference talk at SciPy2015 by Nathaniel Smith and St√©fan van der Walt. In less than 20 minutes, it explained how vision works, what could go wrong and why viridis is a solution. Viridis is a scheme first developed for Matplotlib in Python, but now available in R and Stata as well.

When we needes a set of pre-defined colors for scatterplots or line graphs we picked 5 colors from the scheme (here with their HEX code)
