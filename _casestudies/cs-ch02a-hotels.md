Vienna, Austria is a popular tourist destination for business and leisure. From the hundreds of places that offer accommodation, we want to pick a hotel that is underpriced relative to its location and quality for a weekday in November 2017. What kind of variables could we consider during our search for a good deal? We look at qualitative and quantitative variables and create a data table that we can work with.  

This case study illustrates how to find problems with observations and variables and uses the `hotels-vienna` dataset. It shows how to create a **tidy data table** and how to deal with **missing values** and **duplicates**. It allows instructors to demonstrate the importance of **data cleaning** and the common **steps of data wrangling**.
